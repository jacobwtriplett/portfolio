        "An important question in criminal justice is whether detaining defendants while they await trial affects their ultimate probability of conviction. In this final exam you will use machine learning to estimate the causal effect of pre-trial detention on conviction. In the [shared Econ 484 Google Drive \"datasets\" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gAPP5E0zb4XRd8Ey9eyJ48IIlCCutU9c?usp=sharing) you will find a dataset called \"miami_example.csv\" and the associated codebook \"miami_defs.txt\" that gives some information about each of the variables. The outcome variable is the indicator for conviction. The treatment variable is an indicator pre-trial detention. Possible instrumental variables are dummy variables for each judge. You will have to create the dummy variables from the judge id variable. Additional covariates are age, gender, race, prior offender indicator, number of counts, and indicators for type of crimes in the current charge."
